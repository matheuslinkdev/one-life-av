Ten years ago, I got into a drunken fight with a stranger at a bar, and it ended with him getting seriously injured. I was arrested and charged with assault, but I managed to avoid jail time with a plea deal. I thought I had moved on from that dark chapter of my life, but recently, the victim's family reached out to me, demanding compensation for his medical bills and lost wages. I'm terrified of the legal and financial repercussions, and I don't know how to make amends for my actions.",
